		<p>But obviously not as vauge as that! Specifically, I wish to have a programming-based job.</p>
		<p>What would this job entail? well, here are the specifics, as stated by <a href="https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/15-1251.00">ONET</a>:</p>

			<li>Write, analyze, review, and rewrite programs, using workflow chart and diagram, and applying knowledge of computer capabilities, subject matter, and symbolic logic.</li>
			<li>Correct errors by making appropriate changes and rechecking the program to ensure that the desired results are produced.</li>
			<li>Perform or direct revision, repair, or expansion of existing programs to increase operating efficiency or adapt to new requirements.</li>
