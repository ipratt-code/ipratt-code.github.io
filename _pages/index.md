    <p>This is my website! This website is hosted using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. I
        am
        pretty proud of myself for setting up this website. This website is a <span
            class="infohighlight">static</span> website, which means that this website is all client-side HTML,
        CSS and JS. Take a look around, you might like what you see!</p>
