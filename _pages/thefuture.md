# The Future

What do I want to do for a living? Well, simple: A job in computer science!

But obviously not as vauge as that! Specifically, I wish to have a programming-based job.

What would this job entail? well, here are the specifics, as stated by [ONET](<https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/15-1251.00>):

- Write, analyze, review, and rewrite programs, using workflow chart and diagram, and applying	knowledge of computer capabilities, subject matter, and symbolic logic.
- Correct errors by making appropriate changes and rechecking the program to ensure that the desired	results are produced.
- Perform or direct revision, repair, or expansion of existing programs to increase operating	efficiency or adapt to new requirements.
- Write, update, and maintain computer programs or software packages to handle specific jobs such as	tracking inventory, storing or retrieving data, or controlling other equipment.
- Consult with managerial, engineering, and technical personnel to clarify program intent, identify	problems, and suggest changes.
- Conduct trial runs of programs and software applications to be sure they will produce the desired	information and that the instructions are correct.
- Prepare detailed workflow charts and diagrams that describe input, output, and logical operation,	and convert them into a series of instructions coded in a computer language.
- Compile and write documentation of program development and subsequent revisions, inserting comments	in the coded instructions so others can understand the program.
- Consult with and assist computer operators or system analysts to define and resolve problems in	running computer programs.
- Perform systems analysis and programming tasks to maintain and control the use of computer systems	software as a systems programmer.
- Write or contribute to instructions or manuals to guide end users.
- Investigate whether networks, workstations, the central processing unit of the system, or peripheral	equipment are responding to a program's instructions.
- Assign, coordinate, and review work and activities of programming personnel.
- Train subordinates in programming and program coding.
- Develop Web sites.

The skills required for this above all, according to ONET are:

- Programming (duh)
- Active listening
- Complex Problem solving
- Critical thinking
- Quality control analysis

Most of these jobs in this area also need a 4 year bachelor's degree from college.

But with this is a \~$41 median hourly wage, or \~$86,550 annual wage in America! (2019)
