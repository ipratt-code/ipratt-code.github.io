    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am a programmer who primarily works in python and golang.</p>
    <p>My github page is <a href="https://github.com/ipratt-code">here</a>, if you want to check it out.</p>
    <p>I like these things quite a lot:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheesecake</li>
        <li>Programs compiling successfully</li>
        <li>Chess</li>
        <li>Linux (of any flavors and kinds, I am currently running Pop!_OS)</li>
        <li>Two-Factor Authentication</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I would prefer to follow a profession in the Computer Science industry, probably as someone working with
        machine learning and artificial inteligence</p>
