# About me

I am a programmer who primarily works in python and golang.

My github page is [here](<https://github.com/ipratt-code>), if you want to check it out.

I like these things quite a lot:

- Cheesecake
- Programs compiling successfully
- Chess
- Linux (of any flavors and kinds, I am currently running Debian Sid)
- Two-Factor Authentication

I would prefer to follow a profession in the Computer Science industry, probably as someone working with machine learning and artificial inteligence
