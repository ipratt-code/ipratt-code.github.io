title: "Why All ___ Are Bad is ... bad"
blurb: "Or: why generalization hurts everyone, and helps no one"

There's kind of a talk about how "All Cops Are Bad" is *obviously* correct, while "All Men Are Bad" is *obviously* incorrect.
The problem with both of these statements is that people seem to liberally use the "All ___ Are Bad" pattern matching structure.
This use of this pattern to villify and demean those that are different in one aspect or another is a sadly all-to-common use of a ***false dichotomy***.
For those who may not know, a false dichotomy is when someone posits that there are simply 2 answers to a question/hypothetical/situation.
For example, saying that "All Cops Are Bad" is a false dichotomy because it assumes that all people who are not cops are fine,
while all cops are very much the villan. This is not the case, of course. Being a villan has nothing to do with your job and
position within society. It has to do with your *morality*. Besides, ACAB assumes the following:
* *All* cops we are talking about are similar in that they are part of similar policing systems.
* *All* cops have the same or similar morality and same or similar reasons for joining the police force.
* *All* cops have the same or similar jobs within the police force/policing systems.
* *All* decisions to leave/join the police force are about internal biases and mysoginy/racism/AAPI hate/any other internal bias.
* And the final kicker: *All* cops ***support***  mysoginy/racism/AAPI hate/any other internal bias.


"*Of course* this isn't really true," you may say, "but we *need* less police! Too many cause too much violence!" That, right there is a perfectly fine statement. It is the idea that comes *after* that is the real killer:

"So, if you don't quit the police force, you are a racist mysoginistic anti-AAPI bastard!".

NOOOOOO. NO NO NO NO NO NO NO! People say variations of this statement all the time, and it usually comes down to "if you don't quit,
you obviously hate minorities". THAT IS A ***FALSE DICHOTOMY***!!! There are many reasons why one would stay on the police force:
* It is their only/one of their only reliable sources of income.
* They genuinely want to protect their community, and this is the most direct way to do so.
* It is part of their pride, like how families have long traditions of going into a certain job area.

And so many more reasons I can't list out here, because I don't know them. Every cop has a different reason for joining the police force, so saying
that they joined just out of hating minorities is flawed. And making cops quit to "prove" they aren't bad is just keeping honest people honest.
That has no guarantee that it'll make the actually bad cops leave. It instead makes the concentration of bigots higher and higher, instead of making
it lower or lower, or *actually* solving the problem, which is regulating the supplies cops have *in the first place*, which *prevents* the bad cops from
doing bad things, and *creating laws* to help regulate cop's actions, which punishes the bad cops for doing bad things
